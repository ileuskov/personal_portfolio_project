Hey there! This is a small but tough project. It is my little portfolio built with Django 3.0

This is a pretty simple django app that has a couple of dynamicalyl created web pages:
1) Home page (/home) with my photo and a couple of projects from github
2) Blog page (/blog) with short previews with my blog stories
3) Every single blog can be clicked on and read in a separate page.

This is my first step towards creating and deploying online my own web-portfolio.

The app is made with:
1) HTML, 
2) Python 3.8
3) Django 3.0

Please let me know if I have made any mistakes or my code could be refactored in a more efficient way. Thanks in advance!
